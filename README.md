# bamazon marketplace

In this marketplace, customers can buy merchandise they see for sale. There are two different views within this app. The first is customer-facing, the second is for managers. 


##Customer Facing app
Customers can log in and see the merchandise that is available at Bamazon. Once they find the item they wish to purchase, they can purchase as many of that object as is available. Don't worry, though, if the customer enters in a number that is more than the current stock, they are given a message stating that there are not enough items in stock to fulfill their order. 


##Manager Facing app
Managers have many options to keep on top of their stock in the app. Managers can log in to view the items in the app for sale, view the low inventory in the app so they can be sure to top off their stock to ensure there are no periods of time where they have run out of stock. They can also add more items to their inventory and add new items to their offerings.


###Dependancies
Customers that wish to use Bamazon must have node.js and inquirer.js installed on Visual Studio Code before they can view the market. This is to ensure that they will have the best experience they can possibly have.
